The provided code performs the following tasks:
It reads a list of URLs from an input .txt file.
For each URL in the list, it sends a GET request to retrieve the webpage content.
It searches for a specific pattern (in this case, a mobile number pattern) within the webpage content using regular expressions.
If a mobile number is found, it is extracted and stored in a list.
After processing all the URLs, the extracted mobile numbers are saved to an output .txt file, with each number on a new line.
Finally, the code prints a message indicating the number of URLs processed and the filename where the extracted mobile numbers are saved.
The purpose of this code is to automate the process of extracting mobile numbers from webpages for a given list of URLs. It utilizes regular expressions to search for and extract the mobile numbers in the specified format. The extracted mobile numbers are then saved to a file for further analysis or reference.
